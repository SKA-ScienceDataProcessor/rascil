    The WCS is adjusted appropriately for each raster element. Hence this is a coordinate-aware
    way to iterate through an image.

    Provided we don't break reference semantics, memory should be conserved. However make_flat
    creates a new set of images and thus reference semantics dont hold.

    To update the image in place::

        for r in image_raster_iter(im, facets=2):
            r.data[...] = numpy.sqrt(r.data[...])
            
    If the overlap is greater than zero, we choose to keep all images the same size so the
    other ring of facets are ignored. So if facets=4 and overlap > 0 then the iterator returns
    (facets-2)**2 = 4 images.
    
    A taper is applied in the overlap regions. None implies a constant value, linear is a ramp, and
    quadratic is parabolic at the ends.
